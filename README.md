##angular-audio-player
The HTML default audio is uncomfortable because it is too small to view. The UI does not have a very intuitive feel. The button for playback on the mobile version is too small. so WE created it. The most simple and basic audio player that covers Web/Tablet/Mobile if you want simple and All round cover it's good choice
