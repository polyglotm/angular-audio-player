  <h3>
     Finally, we found the answer
   </h3>
   <p>
     The HTML default audio player does not consider usability 
     in a mobile environment. We needed an audio player that is 
     intuitive and easy to use in any platform.
    <br>
    <br>So we created it.
    <br>
    <br>
     <lc-audio-player 
       audio-src="introVm.audio.audioS3Src"
       auto-play="true">
     </lc-audio-player>
    <br>
    A simple audio player that can be used in any web/tablet/mobile environment. 
    
    if you want simple and All round cover
    it's good choice
   </p>

   <h3>
     Covers web / tablet / mobile resolution compatibility
   </h3>
   <p>
     The component supports min-width: 360px to max-width: 620px. (320px will soon be updated.)
   </p>

   <h3>
     This component was created using angular 1.5.x
   </h3>
   <p>
    This component was created using angular version 1.5. If you are using version 1.4.x,  nowâ€™s the time for migration. 
    Migration from 1.4.x to 1.5.x does not have any compatibility issues.
