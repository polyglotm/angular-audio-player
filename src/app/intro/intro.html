     Simple and cover to Web / Tablet / Mobile resolution
   </h3>
   <p>
    as you can see it's simple.

    I was uncomfortable in the HTML default audio is too small to view.
    I 'm not the UI is very intuitive feel.
    Button to playback on mobile too small.
    
    so i made it.
    
    but stick to the basics and possible to cover Web / Tablet / Mobile
    not to be able to cut anymore
    because it's simple.

    if you want simple and All round cover
    it's best choice
